# Industrial-project for Yimutian Xinnong Technology Inc.

For this project, I have trained an Long-Short Term Memory model to fit on the seller's product descriptions as the input, then generating a probability distribution metrices to realize the categorization procedure of the product labeling. The overarching goal is to develop an auto-detection mechanism within YMT's E Commerce platform, so to prevent product mislabeling. 

Pre-downloaded meterials required for the project's codebook:
1. All three training sets avaliable at this repository
2. Please direct to this link https://pan.baidu.com/s/14JP1gD7hcmsWdSpTvA3vKA to download the pre-trained word vectors (~1.5GB), for the purpose of word vectorization (word embedding) process.


Have fun with exploring the playground!
